Hey, guys,

Laptops and computers are a necessity nowadays, and since most of us use them daily, nothing could happen worse than when they get damaged. Today, I would like to share with you my experience of repairing a laptop that I recently damaged.

The story started one evening when I joined Discord with my friends iZbox and Oliminator to play a game of Valorant. During the game, I held the A key to go left, but it eventually fell out. I tried to put it back in place, but I couldn't, and eventually it completely snapped off. Luckily, the laptop still had one more day of warranty, so we decided to send it in for repair while still under warranty.

After about two weeks, support told us that it was not covered under warranty and we had to pay €110 for the repair, which we thought was an unreasonable amount. The keyboard is only €40, so charging €70 for the work seemed unreasonable to us. So we asked for the laptop back and were subsequently surprised to learn that we could not return it within 30 days. Finally, the service advised us that they would repair the laptop completely free of charge or refund our money. In view of inflation, we decided to have the laptop repaired and now we are just waiting to see when it will be returned to us.

This story helped me understand the importance of warranty and that you should always take care of your devices. It also made me realise that even if a situation seems bad, it can ultimately turn out to be positive. I am grateful that I was able to live through this experience and learn from it.

I hope this story has helped you understand the importance of taking care of your laptops and also shown you that things can get better even if they don't look that way at first. Thanks for reading!
