Last year ðŸ˜„ I discovered the Astro static html framework and after a few hours I fell in love with it. Astro is simple and easy to use, but at the same time it has all the features I need to create professional websites.

My latest project that uses Astro is this website. I was able to quickly build a template and add a tailwindcss for the look and feel of the site to my liking. Astro also allows for easy page creation and many plugins.

What I like most about Astro is that its code is very clean and structured, so it's easy to learn and work with. I also like that I can add custom scripts and files as I need them, so I can customize my site to my exact needs.

I am currently very happy with Astro and plan to use it for other projects. If you're looking for a simple and flexible framework for creating static websites, I recommend giving Astro a try.
