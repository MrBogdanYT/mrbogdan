          My name is <span class="text-gold">Jozef Steinh√ºbl</span> ("bl" - not "bel",
          I'm not a bell), but you may know me by my pseudonyms, <span
            class="text-gold"
            >Hyro, xHyroM, or general_kubo
          </span>. I am a developer with a passion for creating innovative
          solutions, and I am currently engaged in various projects. Most of my
          work is open-source and accessible on <a
            class="text-gold"
            href="https://github.com/xHyroM">GitHub</a
          >, where I contribute to the development of cutting-edge software
          solutions. You can also check <a class="text-gold" href="/projects"
            >Projects</a
          > page on this website.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Apart from my open-source projects, I'm working/have also worked on
          other notable projects such as <a

          > and for different content creators and influencers. My keen interest
          in the latest technologies motivates me to contribute to diverse projects

            Below you can see the technologies I work with and use frequently.

                />
              ))
            }
          </ul>

          I'm still learning with some things like Go and Rust, so I don't have
          a perfect grasp of them, but I've included them in this list anyway.
        </div>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Continuous learning is an essential aspect of my professional journey,
          and while I do not claim to be a master of any programming language,
          my expertise in various languages is continually evolving. As a
          contributor and moderator for the <a
            class="text-gold"
            href="https://bun.sh">Bun</a
          > project, I collaborated with my friend <a
            class="text-gold"
            href="https://github.com/Fire-The-Fox">@FireTheFox</a
          > to develop a native implementation of the <a

            href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1115">node:os module</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
          My passion for learning and staying up-to-date with the latest
          technologies motivates me to take on new challenges and contribute to
          diverse projects.
