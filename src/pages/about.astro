          My name is <span class="text-hyroGold">Jozef Steinh√ºbl</span> ("bl" - not

          </span>. I am a developer with a passion for creating innovative
          solutions, and I am currently engaged in various projects. Most of my
          work is open-source and accessible on <a

          Skills

        <p class="mb-4">
          My skill set spans various programming languages, databases, and
          frameworks.

          <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
            {
              skills.map((skill) => (
                <>

                    <li>{item}</li>
                  ))}
                  <hr class="my-4" />
                </>
              ))
            }
          </ul>

          Continuous learning is an essential aspect of my professional journey,
          and while I do not claim to be a master of any programming language,
          my expertise in various languages is continually evolving. As a
          contributor and moderator for the <a
            class="text-hyroGold"
            href="https://bun.sh">Bun</a
          > project, I collaborated with my friend <a
            class="text-hyroGold"
            href="https://github.com/Fire-The-Fox">@FireTheFox</a
          > to develop a native implementation of the <a
            class="text-hyroGold"
            href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1115">node:os module</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
          My passion for learning and staying up-to-date with the latest
          technologies motivates me to take on new challenges and contribute to
          diverse projects.
